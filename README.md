## C# Live Project Summary
  -In a two-week project, I collaborated with my peers in order to develop a wide scale web application built using ASP .Net MVC, Entity Framework, and C#, HTML, CSS, & razor syntax. I started this live project when it was in the middle of its lifecycle, so I was given the opportunity to help add features, debug, and refactor. With daily scrum meetings, I was able to get experience with a real life software engineering project simulation by gaining experience of peer collaboration, project management, version control, branch merging, and framework. The overall goal of this project is to use the web application as a content management service for a theater company in order to easily manage what content is displayed on their site and create different account access management under different logins on the site such as (admin, subscriber, and member).

* ### Change Layout of the Donor List Page & Add Modal:
 > I styled, organized, and exchanged data that displays on the donor list page of the website. I was able to use model, view, and controller pages to rearrange & change the information showing on the current page, edit some of it, and then display it all in a modal which will be called upon using a "details" button.

* ### Change Layout of the Change Password Page:
 > I added features and changed the layout of the Change Password page following the project styling and display the form. This form can only be accessed if the user is signed in under a subscribers account. This allows for security and content management on the site which was achieved using 
 > (html, c# (razor syntax), and css)
