# C# Live-Project

In a two-week project, I collaborated with my peers in order to develop a wide scale web application built using ASP .Net MVC, Entity Framework, and C#, HTML, CSS, & razor syntax. I started this live project when it was in the middle of its lifecycle, so I was given the opportunity to help add features, debug, and refactoring. With daily scrum meetings, I was able to get experience with a real life software engineering project simulation by gaining experience of peer collaboration, project management, version control, branch merging, and framework. The overall goal of this project is to use the web application as a content management service for a theater company in order to easily manage what content is displayed on their site and create different account access management under different logins on the site such as (admin, subscriber, and member).
